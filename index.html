        <p class="lead">Postmodern gaze in the context of capitalism seeks to illuminate a train of thought in which it breaks down the habits and symbolic capitals of religion, art, and politics by breaking down the taboos necessary for understanding the sciences.</p>

        <p> The intervention of time in the will prevents the continuity of our existence. We can only make the teleological control of existence continuous with will and thinking, so that thinking is not distorted by the arbitrariness of the will. Thinking in a scientific sense results in a different existence than the will of art. The relationship between art and its intended, then, must take on patterns in which tyrannical or personal will does not prevail. Thus, to create quality art, one must find a self-expression embedded in time consciousness that moves in a field where symbolic goods fit well with the artist’s habitus.</p>

        <p>Habitus:</p>
          Bourdieu’s theory of practice is not a theory based on the teleological behavior of actors. Bourdieu consistently opposes the profit-maximizing, teleological logic of the theory of rational decisions that simplifies man into some kind of automaton. At the same time, it also opposes a structuralist-deterministic approach in which agents appear only as functions of structure, without any kind of intentionality. He tries to bridge this by introducing the Aristotelian, Thomist category of habitus, where he makes the attitude of habitus the essence of habitus, defined by practical sense, embedded in structure and conditions of existence, but without precise teleology and rationally reconstructive purpose. It is a system of permanent dispositions: the agents, located in the constraints of the given structure and in the given position system, always do exactly what is most optimal and justified in the given situation. And this habitus works like an athlete’s sense of play: so with socialization, they learn the rules of the game, they know what to adjust to. But what they do in a given interaction already depends on the sense of play, the conditioned improvisation skill. He also uses the term improvisation: agents acquire a potential supply of legitimate behavior during socialization, but what they choose in a given situation, how they manifest themselves, depends on the contingency and historicity of positions in the field and social structure. And here, in the functioning of the habits, Bourdieu devotes a very great role to taste, that is, to the distinctions that develop in the system of symbolic distinctions, which are constantly changing in this approach. And here we can return to the already mentioned thesis about the translational reproduction of structure. What becomes a legitimate distinction, what belongs to the important, and what belongs to the less important, valuable, and less valuable tastes, varies from era to era, and is always defined, legitimized by those in power in a given medium with symbolic rank, cultural capital basic logic of discrimination associated with possession.</p>

        <p>Fields:</p>
          The concept of fields is an extremely important element of this sociology, as the entire social cosmos is made up of a set of such fields. The question of the connection between the fields, the drawing of the boundaries of the fields, is a bit problematic. Bourdieu used to bridge this by always examining the fields in an empirical, historical way, and the boundaries of these — what will be literature or what will be religious activity — always become definable in the specific historical situation. So questions that can be answered not theoretically but through historical empirics. He usually examines each field in relation to certain fields of paramount importance (such as the political field and the economic field) according to how they fit into them. Thinking about these microcosms at a middle level, with historical logic, Bourdieu undoubtedly had very nice and exciting analyzes.</p>
        
        <p>Symbolic capital:</p>
          The concepts of symbolic capital and cultural capital should also be mentioned here. After all, Bourdieu is the sociologist who, as a characteristically modern sociologist, thinks in power, in social reproduction, but sees the existence of this power, the groups appearing in this power, its logic in symbolic distinctions, ie the logic of symbolic forms by making. So in the Bourdieu sense, neither fields nor habits can be understood and operated, they cannot be used without a focus on perceived, perceived symbolic distinctions.</p>
